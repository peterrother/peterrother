### Hey there 👋🏼

I'm Peter, a web application developer and hacker 👨🏼‍💻 based in Cincinnati, with a penchant for traveling 🧳, hiking ⛰, running 🏃🏼‍♂️, speaking German 🇩🇪, and drinking craft beer 🍺. I currently work from home for a local software company and primarily build [Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) solutions. In my spare time, I like to toy with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) apps and create scripts that help save time in my computing life.
